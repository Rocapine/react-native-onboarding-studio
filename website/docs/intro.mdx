# Introduction

Welcome to **Rocapine Onboarding Studio SDK** - A CMS-driven onboarding system for React Native mobile apps.

Build beautiful, customizable onboarding flows that update instantly without app releases.

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

**Onboarding Studio is headless-first**, meaning the core SDK provides all the data fetching, caching, and state management you need, while giving you complete control over the UI.

### Headless Core
The `@rocapine/react-native-onboarding` package provides:
- Data fetching from your CMS
- Caching and offline support
- Progress tracking
- Type-safe hooks and utilities
- No UI components included

### Optional Pre-built Components
The `@rocapine/react-native-onboarding-ui` package offers:
- Ready-to-use screen components for all page types
- Pre-styled components that work out of the box
- Fully customizable through theming and component overrides
- Perfect for rapid prototyping or when you want a quick start

### Choose Your Approach

**Option 1: Use Pre-built Components** (Recommended for most users)
```typescript
import { OnboardingPage } from "@rocapine/react-native-onboarding-ui";

// Use the pre-built component
<OnboardingPage step={step} onContinue={handleContinue} />
```

**Option 2: Build Your Own UI** (Headless approach)
```typescript
import { useOnboardingStep } from "@rocapine/react-native-onboarding";

// Use the hooks to build custom UI
const { step } = useOnboardingStep({ stepNumber: 1 });

// Render your own custom UI based on step.type and step.payload
<YourCustomQuestionScreen step={step} />
```

You can even mix both approaches - use pre-built components for some screens and custom renderers for others!
